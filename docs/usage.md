## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add documentation about anything specific to running your pipeline. For general topics, please point to (and add to) the main nf-core website. -->

## How to run the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run bbglab/deepCSA --outdir <OUTDIR> -profile <DESIRED PROFILE> --input samplesheet.csv
```

For more information on how to run Nextflow pipelines check a more detailed explanation [below](#running-the-pipeline) in this same document or check the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) or [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community documentations.

## Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 3 columns, and a header row as shown in the examples below.

```bash
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

Example:

```csv
sample,vcf,bam
sample1,sample1.high.filtered.vcf,sample1.sorted.bam
sample2,sample2.high.filtered.vcf,sample2.sorted.bam
```

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sample`  | Custom sample name. This entry will be identical for multiple sequencing libraries/runs from the same sample. Sample names cannot contain dots (`.`). Ideally the sample name should have a _Python string-like_ format, it should not be a single number.  |
| `vcf` | Full path to VCF file containing all the mutations called in your sample. It should be uncompressed and with the VCF format field complying with the expected format. See [custom mutation calling](#custom-mutation-calls) below in case the input is not coming from deepUMIcaller.                                                             |
| `bam` | Full path to BAM file containing the duplex aligned reads that were used for the variant calling.                                                             |

An [example samplesheet](../assets/example_inputs/input_example.csv) has been provided with the pipeline.

## Proposed run modes

These are 4 different ways of running the pipeline, each of them serving for a specific purpose, a list of expected outputs is provided in each run mode section.

### Initial run. Data exploration

It will provide:

- Definition of regions to analyze
- Depth per sample and/or per gene
- Somatic mutations
  - Needle plots
- Mutational profile
- Mutational signatures

```console
params {
    plot_depths   = true
    signatures    = true
    profileall    = true
}
```

### Clonal structure definition. Complete run with a focus on positive selection at the cohort-level

It will provide:

- All the previously described outputs plus...
- Mutation density
- Positive selection per gene
  multiple positive selection metrics
  - Per gene, all samples together
  - Per gene, per group of samples
  - Per gene, per sample

```console

    signatures                  = true
}
```

### Mutational processes in alternative genomic regions. Partial run with a focus on mutational processes/signatures

It will provide:

- Same as initial run (even it can be ignored)
- Mutational profile and mutational signatures based on:
  - All genomic regions
  - Only exonic regions
  - Only non-protein affecting regions (synonymous mutations and intronic, intergenic)
  - Intronic and intergenic regions

}
```

### Interindividual variability and sample comparison. Complete run with downstream steps for computation of linear regressions to compare different samples/groups based on clinical variables or sample metadata

It will provide:

    omega_autoexons             = true

    regressions                 = true
    // additional regression parameters, see nextflow_schema.json for more info
      ...
}
```

## Definition of structural parameters

}
```

#### Nanoseq genomic masks

These files identify sites overlapping common SNPs and noisy or variable genomic regions, as described in [Abascal et al, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03477-4) and used in the [Nanoseq pipeline](https://github.com/cancerit/NanoSeq). Two BED files are available to be used:

- Nanoseq SNP: Common SNP positions that should be excluded from analysis
- Nanoseq Noise: Regions with high noise or variability

Both files are available for GRCh37 and GRCh38 at the [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqkgpRTuf4EUhqCGSLA4fIg9qEEw3ZcL) from Iñigo Martincorena's group, at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

## Additional customizable parameters

In addition to several files that can be provided as input listed in the [optional files parameters](#optional-parameters-configuration), there are some more parameters that allow for specific tunnings of the analysis.

### Minimum depth thresholds

There are several depth thresholds that can be defined in the pipeline, I will list them below from the most strict to the least strict.

- consensus_panel_min_depth  = 500

For a given genomic position to be included in the so called "consensus panel" this position needs to have a depth of at least `consensus_panel_min_depth` in at least 80% of the samples. This should always be the highest value among all the depth thresholds and it should be big enough to classify a mutation as somatic vs germline. It should be at least 40.

- sample_panel_min_depth     = 40

This value impacts the creation of sample specific panels that capture which genomics positions have been sequenced to at least this depth in each specific sample. This should be big enough to classify a mutation as somatic vs germline. It should be at least 40.

- mutation_depth_threshold   = 40

This value is used for filtering the mutations by depth. Meaning that if a mutation does not reach this minimum sequencing depth it will not be kept for further analysis. This value should be big enough to be able to classify a mutation as somatic vs germline, and reach a trustworthy computation of the mutation frequency. It should be at least 40.

- use_custom_minimum_depth    = 0

This value is the less stringent depth threshold and is used in the first step of computing the positions that may be part of the so called "panels". This value indicates the minimum average depth at a given position for this position to be kept for the posterior depth analysis and definition on panels. The main use of this value should be to reduce the size of the files that are being processed afterwards. This can be set to 20 or more very safely.

## Custom mutation calls

If you want to run deepCSA with your own mutation calls, this is also possible. Reasons behind this would be:

- the variant calling was not done using deepUMIcaller.
- you came up with a set of mutations that you trust and want to force them as the ones to be used for the analysis.

### Step 1: Generate properly formatted input VCFs

For this, you will need to generate a VCF file per sample with the same format as that expected by deepCSA using the following script that you can find in the deepCSA repository in the following relative path:

`assets/useful_scripts/deepcsa_maf2samplevcfs.py`

The script itself contains this brief explanation on the usage and required parameters:

```{console}
#######
# This script converts a mutations file (TSV format) to one or multiple VCF-formatted files.
#######

#######
# Usage:
#######
## If your sample names are NOT in a column called SAMPLE_ID,
## you can use the --sample-name-column option to specify it.

# if the maf is from deepCSA, use this one
# usage: python deepcsa_maf2samplevcfs.py --mutations-file all_samples.somatic.mutations.tsv --output-dir ./test/ --maf-from-deepcsa

# if the maf file is not from deepCSA, use this one
# usage: python deepcsa_maf2samplevcfs.py --mutations-file all_samples.somatic.mutations.tsv --output-dir ./test/



#######
# Mandatory columns in input mutations:
#######

# if the maf is from deepCSA, it must contain the following columns, as they were originally generated
# ['CHROM', 'POS', 'REF', 'ALT', 'FILTER', 'INFO', 'FORMAT', 'SAMPLE']

# if the maf file is not from deepCSA, then it MUST contain the following columns
# ['CHROM', 'POS', 'REF', 'ALT', 'DEPTH', 'ALT_DEPTH']
# where:
#     DEPTH indicates the total number of duplex reads sequenced at the position where the mutation occurs
#     ALT_DEPTH indicates the total number of duplex reads supporting the variant at the same position
```

### Step 2: Prepare input.csv file

Make sure to prepare the input.csv file with matching the correct VCF-BAM files for each sample.

If you want to run deepCSA as a basic user and ensure that mutations are properly filtered stop here.

### (optional; advanced users) Step 3: Force no filtering of variants

In case you are following these steps to run deepCSA with a set of mutations that you already filtered and trust there is one last thing that you should do.

When running the pipeline you should set the following parameters:

```console
params {
    no_filter               = true
    filter_criteria         = []
    filter_criteria_somatic = []
}
```
